1. Implement functionality for double inputs - Have no two RPC throws be the same

2. Add a win counter that counts when you win and then resets when you lose - Preferably with a fire emoji that is animated using figma

3. Create a more modern look - Need to figure out how to do this

4. Maybe add a highscore


Added:

Added a flashing notification that lets the user know the computer selected the same input, this will help with users understanding that the computer picked the same input 

Added a counter that counts as well as updates with new text if you are on a streak
